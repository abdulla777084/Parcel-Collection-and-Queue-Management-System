public class GUI {

    //staff gui example also has search panel like for parcels

    //Displays customers, parcels, & displays current parcel selected for processing

    //The GUI should show the list of parcels still to be processed, the current queue of customers,
    //and the details of the parcel currently being processed by the worker.

    //Each panel should be updated whenever the data which is displayed in that panel is altered.

    //Do several git commits as you build your GUI.
    //For example, when you build a GUI to display Parcels, commit your new code version to git,
    //do the same when you get to display customers and calculate fees.
    //You should ensure to have at least 4 git commits over the period of your implementation.

    //content box for each:
        //VIEW LIST OF PARCELS that are for collection, if they are collected -> store them in the text file and remove them from the list
        //VIEW QUEUE OF CUSTOMERS

    //output pop-up window for every action of the worker done through a GUI and to console
    //when closing the window - save the data to the text file including the list of parcels

    //Additionally, you should use the MVC pattern to structure your GUI components.
    //The GUI must be built using Swing components (buttons, panels, Frames, etc) to support responsive use of the features of your system
